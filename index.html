        Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you
        around.<br>
        The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where
        they explode. [...]

    <blockquote> This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at
        least had a good imagination.
        And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br>--
